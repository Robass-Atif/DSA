# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains two projects: Mini Excel and DOS Shell, designed to help you understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Mini Excel

### Overview

Mini Excel is a simplified version of the popular spreadsheet software. It provides basic spreadsheet functionalities, such as cell manipulation, formula evaluation, and cell referencing. The project aims to enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms required for building a spreadsheet application.

### Features

- **Cell Manipulation:** Create, update, and delete cells.
- **Formula Evaluation:** Implement basic formula evaluation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) for cells.
- **Cell Referencing:** Support referencing other cells in formulas.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-excel.git`
2. Navigate to the Mini Excel project: `cd mini-excel`
3. Follow the instructions in the project's README file to set up and run the application.

## DOS Shell

### Overview

DOS Shell is a simple command-line interface (CLI) inspired by the MS-DOS prompt. The project aims to reinforce your understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms related to command-line interfaces.

### Features

- **Command Execution:** Implement basic commands (e.g., `cd`, `dir`, `mkdir`, `echo`).
- **Path Handling:** Manage current working directories and handle file paths.
- **Scripting Support:** Execute a sequence of commands from a script file.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dos-shell.git`
2. Navigate to the DOS Shell project: `cd dos-shell`
3. Follow the instructions in the project's README file to set up and run the command-line interface.
